    <a href="http://worldwater.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ww8-table1.pdf">Water data</a>
    <br/>
    My cause is water. Water is obviously important for human survival, growth,
    development, and securing supplies of water for daily use is a prerequisite
    for further advancement in education, human rights, and economic development.
    The data I have linked, on the third to sixth pages of the pdf linked, are
    detailing, by country, the annual renuable water the country accesses, when
    that estimate was made, and who generated the estimate/ how it was estimated.
    This is a surface level but important beginning overview of how people have
    access to water globally, and the grouping by region leads immediately to
    identifying clusters of countries which share access to large amounts of
    clean water. An analysis of this data in conjunction with an identifyier of
    development, maybe GDP per capita, as well as education level, could lead
    directly to a helpful analysis identifying a causative relationship between
    economic development and water access or water access and average education
    level, i.e. as water access increases, education level may increase, as
    water access may be a proxy for general development and infrastructure level,
    and thus by looking at water access, there is likely a positive correlation
    between it and average education of a country's citizens.

    Water is important to me on several levels. I think that the oceans, obviously
    composed of water, are under great threat in terms of the biodiversity of
    species in the ocean, and global warming promises to lead to higher sea levels
    and lower levels of salt in the water, which will probably have large and
    reverberating impacts. I also think water is of social and economic importance,
    as demonstrated by the above, as water access is potentially both an indicator
    of development and a gatekeeper for development of groups of people and countries
    as a whole. Water is also trivially important as it makes up my body. Finally,
    again environmentally but also for people, water matters for sustainable farming
    and ensuring people have food now, but also in the future, i.e. dramatically
    depleting the aquifer with unsustainable farming practices, as is most dramatically
    evident in China on its border with Mongolia, leads to food now, but potentially
    less food in the future. Perhaps the point need not be belaboured further,
    but simply put, water matters very much.
