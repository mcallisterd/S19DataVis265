    <h2>Making Something Great</h2>

          Visualization is effective primarily thanks to how powerful our eyes
          are and how clear certain relationships can be made thanks to a well-
          crafted visualization which takes a complex or large set of data and condenses
          it into a comprehensible set of charts or other ideas. By organizing data
          or grouping informaiton, trends, patterns, and relationships are much
          more easily grasped. In part this is a dangerous thing, as information
          can be presented in a misleading way that supports a potentially biased
          viewpoint or argument.

        <li>
          Depending on your goal with a particular visualization, there is some
          variation in what type of chart is best. When specific, numerical relationships
          are meant to be conveyed, line graphs, bar charts, and "lollipop charts"
          which are aligned along some common scale, with a reasonable baseline,
          often 0 but perhaps something different based on context, are the best way
          to convey a numerical relationship. Other more general trends, like groupings
          based on type or class, that use color or area, can be effective in
          illustrating how certain large groups of objects relate, but are less
          precise, so are best used to merely convey general trends as I prefaced.

          Cairo mentions that hard and fast rules for what visualization is right
          for what situation essentially don't exist, and that there are certain
          charts and graphs which are perhaps right for one situation while broadly
          inappropriate for other tasks. His example with a radar chart to illustrate
          how voting in a Brazilian election unfolded based on geographical region
          is apt, where comparing multiple radar charts on the same axes to
          discern which baseball player, again his example, is better performing
          along certain measures, is by comparison inappropriate unless you mean
          to make interpretting the chart difficult. Again, you choose which chart
          to use based on circumstance: there is no one chart that is always bad
          or one chart that will always yield an excellent visualization, and
          developing a sense for which chart is effective for which task allows
          one to be flexible in designing visualizations to maximize communicative
          power and not overlook promising options.
