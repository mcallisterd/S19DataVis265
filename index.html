<h1>Hello web</h1>
  <p>If you're a determinist then you don't believe in free will and that the laws of nature (physics, etc.) govern all interactions and are the source of all causes. It's complicated but to persuade you in brief I would ask you one, if you actively chose to have thoughts. That sounds like a silly question but considering it one might reach the conclusion that if your actions follow from you impulses, which are not under you control, then your actions are similarly not controlled by you. That may be unconvincing, but I would also submit that you (obviously) cannot have chosen to be born at all, and certainly not to specific parents and circumstances which have unavoidably shaped you into a person who may seem to act freely, but is acting based on principles that you did not choose to adopt. If your perspective is the source of your actions, and you have no control over your perspective, then again I would posit you have no control over your actions. You may still be unconvinced. I am, however. For this reasons, a real way, I think my cause is the first cause. That is, whatever began the universe (big bang?) has inexorably led to the present moment and been the ultimate cause of all of my actions. My cause.</p>
