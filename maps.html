One mistake is in the use of projection. The projection, serving as the basis of a map-based data visualization, 
which ought to be used for a certain situation, a particular goal,
depending on the truth the designer wishes to reveal in the information, varies wildly. Cairo mentions the local scale
power of the Mercator projection, as it preserves shapes and angles, while on a larger scale, the amount which area
is distorted by a Mercator projection means one probably ought not use it. Overall the particular projection is a small,
 but important detail in creating a map-based data visualization, which is often a (admittedly small, usually) mistake that is made
 in designing one.
