One mistake is in the use of projection. The projection, serving as the basis of a map-based data visualization, 
which ought to be used for a certain situation, a particular goal,
depending on the truth the designer wishes to reveal in the information, varies wildly. Cairo mentions the local scale
power of the Mercator projection, as it preserves shapes and angles, while on a larger scale, the amount which area
is distorted by a Mercator projection means one probably ought not use it. Overall the particular projection is a small,
 but important detail in creating a map-based data visualization, which is often a (admittedly small, usually) mistake that is made
 in designing one.

 Another mistake in map visualizations can be made when using scales: gradient color scales and shapes which represent data, like circles,
 can be difficult to use properly. Color scales can go wrong by providing too little contrast to effectively allow a consumer of your
 visualization to distinguish one country or state, for example, from another. Even if the colors are easy to distinguish, if large areas
 of the map are the same color, one could probably adjust the scale to more effectively delineate nuances in the data, where there is a 
 particular breakpoint or dividing line. Circles and size representations of data can go wrong in myraid ways. If you were presenting data
 on a global level, as Cairo mentions, you would emphasize large countries' data more than small countries, if they are not size-adjusted,
 simply because of the geographic reality, while the most interesting, revelatory portion of your visualization may concern medium to small
 countries in particular, and the U.S. and Russia are essentially irrelevant, but occupy a great deal of visual real estate. If you use circles
 to represent data points, then Cairo emphasizes that scaling them properly is essential, lest you double your intended magnification. Finally,
 in using size to show data, the visualization can get very visually "busy," with a great number of pieces crammed in. Rescaling to ensure
 that the small pieces of the visualization aren't obscured by large ones, and that the map isn't overly demanding of your consumer, can 
 ensure your message is more effectively communicated.
